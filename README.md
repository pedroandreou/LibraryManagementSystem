# Outcomes:
- Loaded txt files using the pandas 'to_sql' method
- Followed STAR schema
- Created fact tables and dimension tables programmatically (look at "create_dimension_table" function in "database.py" file)
- Mapped values to ids programmatically for assigning them as keys to tables (look at "map_vals_to_ids" function in "database.py" file)
- Set expiration dates to people that reserve or checkout a book (reservation can last for 10 days while checkout for 30 days)
- Created reusable code for the widgets; for example, the two buttons on the bottom of each page, "Go Back" and "Submit" can be added by calling the "create_bottom_button_widgets" function, same applies for the entry and label widgets ("create_label_entry_widgets" function).
- Instead of destroying the frame of each page by doing:
```
def destroy_page_widgets(self):
  for i in self.master.winfo_children():
    i.destroy()
```
I am hiding and turn the frames to visible again when appropriate (see at "show_frame" and "hide_frame" function in "gui.py" file)
- Created images using draw.io in combination with GIMP software and added them to Tkinter buttons
- No point of writing dot code for visualising the ERD diagram of my DB. Used DBeaver software to generate the diagram automatically and made the images transparent using the GIMP software
- Autocomplete of suggested book titles feature added to the "Search Book" page using the ttkwidgets library


# Notes:
- In case you want to check if the normalization really happens which would require to change some of the data in the txt files; make sure the db file is deleted
before you run the program again as it won't load the changes. The reason is because I am checking if the db exists and in case it does,
then I skip the loading part since it only needs to be loaded once. In case of loading the db every single time the program runs, then the data would be always overwritten and the user's changes would be always lost after the end of a session

# Future Work if had more time:
- Adding a vertical scroll bar to the TreeView widget for better UX but nevertheless, the user can still scroll without one

## Recommendations for adding features:
- popularity about 1 and multiple books (reservation should be taken into consideration, purchase date should be taken into consideration)


# Environment
## How to set up a virtual environment on Windows:
```
  cd .\LibraryManagementSystem\
  python -m venv .venv (To create virtual environment)
  .venv\Scripts\activate (Activate virtual environment)
  pip install -r requirements.txt (Install all required packages)
```

## In case your Windows OS is not well set-up, do the following:
Add the following environment variables in the Path of *User variables for user*:
```
C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python<yourpythonversion>\Scripts  (e.g. C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Scripts)
C:\Users\user\anaconda3
C:\Users\user\anaconda3\Scripts
C:\Users\user\anaconda3\Library\bin
```

Add the following environment variables in the *System Variables*:
```
C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python<yourpythonversion>  (e.g. C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39)
```

## How to set up a virtual environment on Linux:
You should create a virtualenv with the required dependencies by running
```
make virtualenv
```

How to activate the virtual environment:
```
source ./.env/bin/activate
```

When a new requirement is needed you should add it to `unpinned_requirements.txt` and run
(this ensures that all requirements are pinned and work together for ensuring reproducibility)
```
make update-requirements-txt
```

## How to run sqlite3.exe file on Linux:
```
pip install wine
wine sqlite3.exe
```

## How to play around with my db on Linux:
```
sudo apt install sqlite3
./LibraryManagementSystem/data
sqlite3 library.db
```
